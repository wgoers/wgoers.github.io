# Welcome

In this little personal digital garden I collect insights, experiences and practical tips from my professional work in **software development** - with a special focus on **full-stack development**, **clean code**, **software architecture** and modern **development processes**.

![Alt-Text](img/intro-index.jpg)

Whether well thought-out architecture decisions, proven best practices, useful code examples or *lessons learned* from real projects - my goal is to pass on knowledge (and honestly to save it for myself if I forget something) and maybe you will find new impulses for your own work here - or simply an inspiring look outside the box.

**Have fun discovering!**
